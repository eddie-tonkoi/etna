Rule 1: Do Not Take It to Heart.

Some people like cemeteries.

The best ones come to sit and remember. Quiet souls who bring flowers, talk a little, and leave the air softer than when they arrived. There are others too, the ones who take what isn’t theirs, or come to chase a thrill among the stones. I’ve little patience for them.

And then there are the dead. I don’t know if they like it here, or if liking has nothing to do with it.

And me—I’m the only living resident of St Aubin’s Rest, though some days the word living feels generous.

“Lucien.”

Her voice drifts through the still air—thin as smoke, fragile as the breeze through dry grass.

I stop and glance behind the old rose bush, a vast, untamed thing whose branches arch like ribs over the gravel. Its blooms have come back with sudden abundance after the rain fortnight ago, crimson petals beaded with dew and the faint scent of rust. Beneath it stands Odette, her small shape half-lost in the green. She turns, eyes pale and clouded like morning mist. She’s been a quiet fixture in my days for as long as I can remember—a presence more than a person, a voice that returns no matter the season. I’ve often wondered if she truly sees me, or only feels the air shift where I stand. Best not to ask.

“Odette,” I say quietly. “Good morning.”

She brightens at once. “Oh, good morning, dear. Have you seen him about today?”

“Not yet. Still another hour before visitors.”

“Ah, yes… of course.” Her smile deepens, folding into the fine creases that map her cheeks, the sort of lines made by a lifetime of kindness. Then she fades a little into the light, content to wait.

I move on, following the winding path through the graves. The stones dot the grassy hill like teeth in an old jaw—some white and clean as bone, others eroded to ghosts of names. Angel wings without faces. Crosses sunk at odd angles, tilting towards the valley below. A warm wind rises from the south, carrying the scent of thyme and dust from the fields. The first breath of summer. It whispers through the cypress and the wildflowers between the plots, stirring the edges of my coat.

The office squats at the end of the lane just inside the main gate—one small room and a toilet block, both the colour of old plaster. A red truck is parked at an impatient angle across the gravel. I sigh under my breath. The trust’s been hiring extra hands again. “Casual labourers,” they call them. Strangers to the dead, I call them. They never stay long enough to learn the ground’s temperament.

The door creaks as I push it open. A man in a red cap steps out of the toilet, wiping his hands on his jeans. He gives me a nod—or maybe just a grunt—and mistakes me for another day-hand.

Fine by me.

We walk into the office.

Inside, a young woman I don’t recognise looks up from the desk. Her smile falters when her eyes land on me. To her credit, she pulls it back—trained reflex, maybe kindness. I tug the hood lower without thinking. It’s habit now, the small mercy of sparing people the sight of what’s left of me. Easier for them. Easier for me. Keeps the clean distance from the living.

Mrs Arnaud told me last month she was retiring. I hadn’t wanted to believe her. Seeing this young woman behind the desk, neat blouse, hair pinned up against the heat, makes the truth settle. Must be her granddaughter.

“M-morning,” I mumble, hoping my voice stays small.

“Morning,” she replies, brave enough to sound almost steady.

She tears a sheet from the pad and scribbles notes with brisk, nervous movements. “Open plot DA73 for tomorrow’s service. Head-end to the west. And please remember the tarp under the spoil heap this time.”

“Yeah, yeah,” says Red Cap, bored already.

She stiffens, keeping her tone even. “The canvas lining’s in the storage. Put it down before you leave.” The pen bites through the page, a sharp little scar on the desk. She adds another note or two—insurance against the kind of man who’ll misplace the instructions before he’s lifted a spade.

I open my battered logbook and turn near the end—only a few pages left. I’ll need a new one soon. I’d asked Mrs Arnaud before she left, but she must have forgotten. There’s no real reason I should keep my own burial record; the trust already holds the official ledgers. Mine is private, unnecessary.

Still, I pull the leather-bound copy towards me and begin copying the details into my little book. I always write each name carefully, reverently—as if the act itself were prayer. For many of them, this will be the only trace of their lives I’ll ever hold.

Jonathan Rowan Graye

Resident of Pontarçon

1 Blackthorn Close

Twenty years old

I pause, the number pressing heavy behind my ribs. Twenty. A few years younger than me.

Rule number one from Gideon’s Gravedigger handbook: Do not take it to heart.

I swallow.

Miss Arnaud glances at the page, perhaps to fill the silence.

“So young,” she says quietly. “Our job isn’t to ask questions—only to turn the earth and close him over.”

I manage a small smile she barely sees. “Yes, miss.”

Her eyes meet mine for a heartbeat, then politely look away.

“It’s fine. I know what I’m doing,” the man cuts in, snatching the paper before she’s done writing. The pen scrapes, the page tears slightly under his impatience. He strides out and slams the door.

Miss Arnaud flinches at the noise. “… Don’t forget the grave boards,” she calls weakly after him.

I nod once, murmuring, “I’ll make sure, miss.”

Outside, the sunlight feels sharp after the dim office. The air is warm, almost sweet—the kind of morning that makes the soil easy to turn. A good day for digging, if ever there is one.

From behind the building comes the sound of the man muttering and cursing, tools clattering in the shed. I’d rather not cross his path, so I take the other way. There are chores enough that don’t require company.

Plot DA73—the new zone, just beyond my cottage. I can see it in my mind already: the slope soft with grass, an old rowan keeping watch over the ground. Its branches are heavy with late-spring leaves—feathered green touched with copper, and clusters of white blossom that catch the light like scattered ash. The tree is older than anyone who’ll ever rest beneath it. From there, the view opens towards the valley below.

I know every rise and turn of this place by heart. It’s my duty to know it and, I suppose, my privilege too.

Tomorrow’s the funeral. I’ll need to clear the path for the bearers when they bring him through the west gate.

Across the yard, Red Cap hauls a spade and a shovel over his shoulder, still grumbling about the tarp. I watch him go, then turn back towards the graves, where the air is quieter and the ground knows my name.

The path slopes gently down towards my cottage—the caretaker’s place. The building sits low against the hillside, stones weathered and lichened, probably as old as the cemetery itself. Mrs Arnaud once told me it was built for the first groundsman, long before records began; I like to think the walls have listened to every spade strike since.

It claims the best spot in St Aubin’s Rest, tucked just below the chapel rise, facing the valley. From here, Pontarçon spills down the slope like a patchwork of old roofs and narrow lanes, all the way to where the river glints in the distance. Smoke lifts from morning chimneys; a church bell rings somewhere far off, soft and out of time with ours.

Children’s voices drift faintly upwards, carried on the wind. A sunny orange school bus winds down the narrow road and glides over the Vale bridge, sunlight flickering across its windows like mirrors catching ghosts.

For a moment, I imagine the lives inside them—people with destinations, appointments, reasons to hurry. The world keeps turning down there, polite enough to pretend I’m still part of it.

I pause at the bend in the path, watching the town. The sight always feels both familiar and foreign—like something I dreamt once and then misplaced. I haven’t crossed that bridge in years. Not since I came to live with Gideon. From here, the distance is easier to manage; it looks almost kind.

Outside my cottage, the birch leans towards the valley, its pale bark peeling in thin, papery curls. The first flush of green trembles along its branches—new leaves, soft as silk, catching the light. A blackbird chatters from the topmost bough, its song skipping through the still air. I walk past beneath its dappled shade.

The cottage door sticks a little; it’ll only get worse once the summer rain sets in. I’ll see to the hinges tonight.

Inside, the air smells of earth and lamp oil—my own kind of comfort. The cottage isn’t large, but for one person it’s more than enough. The front room serves as kitchen, sitting space, and workshop all at once. One side is lined with shelves and pegs where I keep my tools—each cleaned, oiled, and arranged with quiet devotion.

Spades of different blades, tamping rods, ropes, canvas tarps. The saws and shears hung in pairs like polite companions. Secateurs gleam under the dim window light; the measuring staff leans by the wall beside my little dining table.

Call it snobbishness or hoarding if you like—I prefer to call it professional pride. Ever since the trust started bringing in hired hands, I’ve kept my best tools in here, away from curious fingers. Those lads mean well enough, but they treat a spade like it’s a stick for stirring soup. Leave it out overnight, edges dull with rust by morning.

The shears catch my eye. The hedges could do with a trim; they always get unruly after rain. I lift them down, test the hinge, then set them neatly in the barrow. The secateurs follow, and the small rake.

After a pause—thinking of Red Cap and his fine opinion of tarpaulins—I add the shovel as well. Better safe than sorry.

By late afternoon, the light softens to honey and dust. I tidy the gravel paths, gathering stray branches and clippings left by the morning wind. The broom rasps softly over stone; the sound settles into the stillness. When the barrow’s full, I take the waste round to the compost by the utility yard. The air there always smells of damp earth and sweet rot—the kind of scent that lingers on your hands no matter how hard you wash.

As I make my way back past the office, the red truck is gone.

Has he finished already? That’s fast.

I knock on the door, but no answer comes. The place feels hollow without voices. Around the corner, the shed stands open, afternoon light pooling across the threshold. The grave boards are still stacked neatly against the wall. I sigh. Miss Arnaud had looked so determined when she gave the instruction.

“Well,” I mutter, “someone’s got to do it.”

I lift the boards into the barrow—heavy things, warped with age—and start the walk westwards.

The rowan marks the edge of the new ground. It blocks the sun just enough that the grave lies half in shade, half in fire. The air shimmers with drifting dust and gnats. Sunspots dance across the spoil heap like coins scattered over dark soil.

I stop a few paces short. The open ground always holds me still for a moment—a quiet that feels older than breath. To most, it’s a hole in the earth. To me, it’s something closer to a confession. A space where the living and the dead meet in truth. I’ve never known a place more honest.

I walk to the edge and look down. At least Red Cap had attempted to square the corners. He hadn’t bothered to shore up the sides, and the lining’s nowhere to be seen. The tarp is there—one point to him—but no boards, no care for collapse.

I let out a low breath.

If I’m being truthful, I don’t really mind these half-hearted jobs. They give me something to put right. My tribute to the dead, if you like.

I fetch the shovel from the barrow and start trimming the edges, making them true. The soil’s soft from the rain two weeks ago; it crumbles easily under the blade. The rhythm steadies me—scrape, lift, turn.

The sun slips lower, the rowan tree losing its hold on shade. Heat builds between my shoulders. My coat’s already smeared with mud, heavy as wet paper. I pull the hood down, unbutton the front, and toss it onto the edge of the pit.

The air clings to me. Sweat makes the shirt stick tight across my chest; the burn beneath it prickles as if newly made. The scars always wake when the heat does. I glance around—the gates are shut, the paths empty. Only the wind and the stones for company. I strip the shirt off with reluctance.

“That’s better,” I say, half to myself.

I brace the grave walls with boards—careful work, the kind Gideon taught me. The rain’s left the soil tender, quick to give way if not respected. Each plank goes in with measured taps of the mallet, the sound dull and rhythmic with my breathing. There’s comfort in it, the ritual of it.

“I always thought it was just a hole.” The voice startles me. Warm, edged with amusement, like sunset caught in sound. “Do you put in this much work every time?”

I jolt upright. Panic grips before sense. My hand goes to my face, instinctive, covering the left side—before I remember I’m bare to the waist. The light’s low now, merciful, the last of it filtering through the leaves. Still, I snatch up the coat and drag it on, pulling the hood close over my head.

“The… cemetery’s closed,” I manage, my voice harsher than intended.

“I know.” The voice again—easy, untroubled by guilt. “But I had to check on behalf of my family.”

“The Grayes?” I ask, glancing up.

A young man stands at the edge, the sky burning behind him. Slim build, brown hair tousled by the wind, the kind of face that belongs in sunlight.

“That’s me,” he says. There’s a pause then, a trace of guilt softening the brightness.

I should offer condolences—that’s what decent people do—but the words stick. Maybe it’s the cheer in his tone, leaving no room for sympathy, or maybe it’s that he’s looking at me. Being seen always stops the mouth first. Either way, nothing comes out.

So I turn back to the grave and the work that steadies me. The board slides in, the soil shifts, the world rights itself.

After a moment, he speaks again, lighter this time. “You look like you’re waiting for the ground to swallow you. Mind if I sit on the edge?”

I glance over my shoulder. No point arguing. He’s already settled himself on the spoil heap, one knee bent, sunlight pooling round him like he belongs there.

I tap the boards in place with the mallet, quick and deliberate. It’s easier to focus on the task than the eyes watching me. When it’s done, I climb out, brushing soil from my palms. He’s stretched back on the heap, staring up at the sky like it’s his own ceiling.

He glances over, waiting.

I should speak—something polite, human—but habit wins.

“The lining,” I mumble, and wheel the barrow away before the silence can lengthen.

By the time I return with the canvas, the place is empty. The grave sits quiet in the falling dusk, edges neat, walls braced, boards secure. The air has cooled; the rowan stirs with a low susurrus, its leaves speaking a language only the dead might understand.

I set the canvas down beside the hole and rest my hand on the shovel. The night air whispers, soft and amused.

Maybe I imagined him.

Wouldn’t be the first time.
