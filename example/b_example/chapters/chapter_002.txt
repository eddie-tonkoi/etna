Rule 2: Arrive Early. The Guest of Honour Won’t Mind.

The morning lies still beneath a low sky. Cool air gathers in the hollows, damp with the scent of turned soil and morning dew. I pull on my coat and step out just after dawn, the world still half-asleep. The grass clings to my boots, whispering, and the stones wear their sheen like thin glass.

The birds are quiet today. Word gets around, even among them, when a burial’s due.

Odette’s bench stands empty next to her grave—her shawl folded over the armrest, forgotten or meant as a sign she’ll be gone awhile. It feels wrong without her watching the gate. I circle the grounds, checking the fences, the paths, the grave itself. Nothing out of place. I brush a stray leaf from the canvas I’d laid over the pit last night and straighten the boards beside it.

The faint swell of the organ drifts from St Mary’s—slow and solemn, like the land remembering how to pray. The choir follows, a pale ribbon of sound tangled in the mist. It sounds older than the valley, older than grief.

By the time the sun pushes through the clouds, Red Cap appears at the edge of the path. He trudges over, shoulders hunched, hands buried deep in his coat pockets. His eyes narrow at the canvas.

“Someone’s been at my work,” he mutters, crouching to prod at the lining I’d set in last night.

I say nothing—just stoop nearby, pretending a sudden concern for a wilted bouquet in a grave vase. Wise to let him think the ghosts did it.

He huffs, straightens, brushes the dirt from his knees. For a moment his gaze hooks on me—suspicion sharp beneath his cap’s brim—but he says nothing. Only spits into the soil and mutters about amateurs before stalking off towards the tool shed.

From the west gate comes the sound of tyres on gravel. Miss Arnaud arrives with two lads from the Vale Funeral Home, each carrying boxes of flowers and the folded awning for the stand. Red Cap, in an uncharacteristic mood, strides forward to help—taking a box from her arms before I can. She gives him a tired smile. Between us, we set the props around the open ground with the ease of long habit.

Within minutes the burial plot takes its shape—

a trestle draped in white cloth for the photograph,

a ring of metal stands for the flower displays,

a small wooden lectern for the priest’s notes,

and a strip of green matting over the boards to keep the mourners from the mud.

Everything neat, measured, temporary.

Miss Arnaud kneels beside a cardboard box, opening it with care. Inside lies a framed photograph wrapped in tissue. She lifts it out, wipes a faint mark from the glass, and sets it on the stand.

The face inside smiles—young, gentle, unguarded. I pause, already know who this is. Jonathan Graye, aged twenty.

The sight catches somewhere low in my chest. I’ve seen that smile before.

I move nearer, unable to stop myself.

Yes—exactly the same, the lightness of it. The smile that looked down at me last night.

A hush passes through the air. Even the soil seems to listen. Then the bell at St Mary’s tolls—slow, singular—its sound sliding down through the cloud like iron sinking in water.

The bearing begins.

I let out a quiet sigh, half wonder, half weariness, and step back from the plot.

Rarely does a soul linger in this world after death. When they do, it’s for reasons that cling close to the heart. Odette waits for her husband still, sitting by the gate each morning. Some of the lads keep watch for a war long ended, certain the bugle will sound again. They hover near their own stones, patient as weather.

But the lad from last night… he didn’t seem the waiting sort. There was nothing troubled in him, no binding I could feel. Just that smile—easy, careless, but unreal.

Still, no sense puzzling over it. Most ghosts fade soon after their funeral rites are done, as though all they wanted was to stand once more among the living, to feel the warmth of love one last time before letting go.

I wander towards the west gate. A long row of cypress trees flanks the path there—old giants, their trunks dark and furrowed, their crowns tapering into the pale sky. They stand close together like weary soldiers keeping their final watch, the wind threading softly through their limbs.

Beyond them, through the gaps of green, the cortège winds up the lane—the hearse first, its black glass gleaming faintly beneath the dull morning light. The slow rhythm of tyres on gravel hums through the ground, steady as a heartbeat drawing nearer. The door shuts with a hollow thud, followed by the shuffling of shoes. Pallbearers move in steady time, the priest ahead, murmuring his prayer. Behind them trail the mourners—black coats, veils, lace trembling in the chill breeze.

I fall into step at the back, quiet as shadow, my gaze searching the procession.

But the face from last night isn’t among them.

The cortège comes to halt beside the grave. Miss Arnaud gives her small nod, the one that tells the world to be still. The priest opens his book; the page flutters in the breeze, thin and pale as a moth’s wing. His voice rises and falls like the tide, washing through the silence: dust to dust, ashes to ashes. I’ve heard those words so many times they’ve turned to rhythm, not meaning—the soft cadence of letting go.

It’s then I see him.

A figure at the far side of the mourners—tall, slight, dressed too loosely for the cold. Layers of muted cloth, a scarf looped round his neck in a way that seems careless, almost bohemian. He moves through the gathered crowd like wind through reeds, quiet, unbothered by the bodies he passes.

He stops beside a woman in black satin and veil. Mrs Graye, I realise—his mother. She doesn’t turn.

“Mother,” he says, or mouths it; I can’t hear the sound, only see the shape of the word. He touches her arm, but his hand stirs no response. The man beside her glances up, brows drawn, but looks straight through him.

Jonathan’s face changes then. The brightness I saw in the photo is gone; what stands here is older somehow—drawn, colourless, eyes hollow with grief. He looks at his mother as though willing her to see.

The priest’s voice steadies, closing the rite. “Into your hands, O merciful Saviour, we commend thy servant.” He gestures to the bearers.

I keep to the edge as the lads lower the coffin. The ropes creak, stretched under weight. Earth shifts beneath my boots. Miss Arnaud kneels to arrange the wreaths—white lilies, yellow roses, the same careful order her mother always kept. Her breath clouds faintly in the chill air. Around us, the mourners whisper; some pray, others only stare, uncertain whether to believe in endings.

I glance again at Jonathan. He forces a small smile, still trying to reach his mother. She doesn’t respond. The priest closes his book, and the tight cluster of mourners loosens. People move, step around the grave, but he stands unmoving, eyes fixed on the coffin now resting in the pit.

Then comes the soft thud of earth against wood—that dull, hollow sound that never leaves the bones.

I bow my head out of habit more than faith. The scent of wet soil thickens, and I feel it—that faint shift in the air, the moment when warmth leaves the world. The space beside the grave seems lighter, emptier.

When I look up, there’s a shimmer at the edge of sight, as if the air bends in on itself. I blink, and it’s gone.

He’s gone.

A long breath escapes me before I notice it. Relief, perhaps, or something close to it.

The service ends. The mourners drift back towards the cars, voices low, footsteps muffled in the grass. Miss Arnaud stays behind to gather the leftover flowers. Red Cap folds the matting, muttering about the damp. I fetch the boards.

Before I leave, I glance once more at the photograph. That same smile greets me—unguarded, eternal. I catch myself smiling back.

“Rest easy,” I mumble.

The afternoon settles grey and heavy over the valley. The light has thinned to pewter, the kind that makes every shadow linger too long. After the committal, Miss Arnaud and the lads from the Vale linger by the grave, checking ropes, clearing petals, murmuring over the neatness of things. Red Cap hangs back in his usual sour mood, waiting for them to leave so he can fill the pit. Too many people, too many reasons to be busy. I leave them to it.

The mourners have gone. Their tyre tracks fade quickly into the gravel as I push my barrow towards the car park. A few stray ribbons and damp tissues lie scattered near the gate. I gather them in silence, drop them into the bin, and tamp the lid shut. The smell of wet soil and wilted flowers clings to the air.

I steer the barrow along the row of cypress trees, their tall shapes lining the cemetery’s edge. Beneath them, the ground is soft with fallen needles. I stoop with the rake, drawing slow, even arcs until the soil breathes again.

I glance up at the fourth tree from the car park. Its trunk split years before I came here, a wound long braced by Gideon’s hand. He’d bound it with wooden stakes and rope; it’s still thriving, stubborn as anything that refuses to die. Now and then I replace the rope, but otherwise, it manages well enough on its own. I take a stiff brush from the barrow and sweep at the moss that’s crept up the lower bark. Resin scents the air—sharp, clean, almost holy. As I work, I feel the faint stir, that slow watchfulness I’ve come to know.

Within the grain of the rough bark, a pair of eyes open—pale, recessed, like knots that learned to see. They blink once, slow and ancient.

“We’re putting one down today,” I say quietly.

The eyes drift towards me, the lids half-closed, a patient acknowledgement.

“Everything’s fine, Old Chap. Thank you for keeping watch.”

The eyes close again, sinking back into wood.

I finish brushing the trunk and sweep away the dry cones. When I straighten, I rest my hand against the bark a moment longer than I mean to. This ghost—I never learned his name. A soldier, I think, from the Great War. His name is carved and fading somewhere among the stones. He’s been here longer than anyone, too long, until the earth finally claimed him, folded him into the roots. Now the tree breathes for him. All I can do is keep the ground clean and the needles raked.

Sometimes I wonder why I can see them at all. I like to think there’s a reason—a purpose, maybe divine. Perhaps I’m meant to help them find their way. But I don’t know how. They stay because they choose to, and I’m only the caretaker of their silence.

The evening settles over the grounds like a cool, damp cloth. Somewhere behind the slate of cloud, the sun exhales its last breath of gold—no more than a shimmer caught on the western stones.

I stop by the cottage to fetch the hand tamper. It’s purpose-made for the job, the handle worn smooth by years of use. The shepherd’s crook leans against the wall beside it. I take that too—might be out for a while.

The lantern hangs from its hook just outside the door. I check the oil, trim the wick, strike the match. The light flares, soft and steady. I hang it from the crook and set it across my barrow. As I walk, the lantern swings, spilling thin slices of amber through the dark.

The cemetery after closing hour is mine alone. The gates are locked, the roads silent. A blackbird gives one last sharp note before folding into the hedge. Insects murmur low to the grass, a pulse beneath the air. Everything else holds its breath.

The old rowan leans at the edge of the lower ground, where the fence gives up and the earth begins its slow fall towards the valley. Before the trust opened this patch for burials, I used to come here when the air felt too thick. The branches tremble like bones remembering how to move. Even in summer the leaves keep a tired green, rubbed down to ash. But the berries—those are stubborn. Bright as drops of blood caught in dusk. The birds strip them bare each winter, and still the tree keeps trying.

Gideon used to say old trees keep the dead from wandering, that’s why they plant them along the cemetery edge. I never knew if it was true or just something he told to quiet a boy’s fear, but I like to think the trees listen. When the wind moves through the rowan, the sound is softer than prayer. Like someone breathing through the cracks of the world.

I leave the barrow on the gravel and step onto the new mound. The ground gives a little under my boot. Red Cap’s done a decent job for once. I take up the tamper and press the soil in slow, steady strokes. Each thud settles the earth a little closer to rest. The scent rises—raw, mineral, clean.

Then the rake. I draw the teeth through the soil until the mound lies even and calm, a low rise smoothed like a blanket. The ribs it leaves are faint as a signature—mine, but quiet. Maybe Red Cap will notice, wonder if the dead tidy their own beds at night.

There.

Perfect.

I step back. Jonathan would be pleased, I think.

I sweep stray soil from the turf, fetch the watering can from the barrow, and climb the slope to the tap. A little water to settle the dust, to bind the surface so the soil will take.

When I walk back down, something catches my eye—a faint glow behind the rowan, where the fence gives way to open dark. Moonlight drifts across the slope, pale as breath, and for a moment I think it’s only the lantern swinging.

Then I see him.

A figure standing still among the roots.

The air tightens. The flame in my lantern flickers, guttering low. I can feel the ground draw cold beneath my boots.

I thought he’d gone—crossed wherever the others go.

But Jonathan Graye hasn’t gone anywhere.

He lingers there, half in shadow, as if the earth itself won’t take him.

And I don’t know whether to call his name… or start digging again.
