Rule 3: Never Speak First to a Ghost.

There’s a new addition to the residents of St Aubin’s Rest.

The afternoon lies soft and sunlit, the kind of spring day that makes even the stones look warm. A breeze stirs the cypress tops, scattering their dry scent through the air. I push the barrow along the gravel path, its wheel crunching steady beneath the sound of birds. The sun catches on the rims of the spade and rake clinking in rhythm.

That’s when I see him again—Jonathan Graye.

He’s wandering between the graves, head tilted, as though he’s misplaced something and can’t quite remember what. Now and again he crouches, fingers brushing names into the air, eyes scanning every letter as if he expects to decipher life’s mysteries. The sun threads through his hair, and for a moment he looks more solid than he should.

My pace slows without meaning to. The barrow’s rattle fades into the hush of birdsong.

Then, as if he feels the weight of my stare, his head snaps up. Our eyes meet. I stop dead, breath snagging in my throat.

He brightens at once—a broad, living smile that doesn’t belong here. He waves, quick and cheerful, like I’m an old friend instead of the keeper of his grave.

The barrow jolts as my hand slips. I catch it before it runs away downhill. My heart thuds once, hard, probably trying to remind me I’m still here. Instinct drives me one step back.

What an odd thing, to grin so easily after your own burial only last week.

Obviously, he’s climbed back up again—bright-eyed, all energy and eagerness, as if death were nothing more than a brief nap.

I turn the barrow away, the crunch of gravel loud in my ears. Friendliness has always unsettled me more than ghosts do; it asks for something I don’t have to give. Perhaps the lad will realise soon enough that he’s made the biggest mistake of his after-life, and take his leave in peace.

That would be best.

For both of us.

The path bends towards the old bench beneath the roses—Odette’s bench. The air grows heavy with their sweetness; crimson petals open wide in the sun, some already turning at the edges. They could do with a little care. I fetch the secateurs from the barrow and make my way over.

Odette is crouched before her own headstone, her translucent skirts brushing the gravel.

“What are you doing down there?” I ask.

She looks up at once, her smile soft but tired. “Lucien, dear heart,” she says, voice thin. “The roses.”

I follow her gaze. The vase at her feet holds only wilted stems, heads drooping, the water turned cloudy green. She reaches for them, but her pale fingers pass through as though she’s stirring smoke. Her smile trembles; confusion clouds her face.

“Here now,” I say, crouching beside her. “Let me see to it. That’s what I’m here for.”

I lift the vase, tipping the dead blooms into the barrow before turning to the rosebush.

Odette rises beside me, watching closely. “But you planted this rosebush for me,” she says, glancing at the thick, blooming shrub. “So I might pick them myself.”

She reaches out to pluck one—but her hand slips straight through, scattering only sunlight, as if she’s forgotten how to touch the world at all. Her brow creases, confusion softening into quiet sorrow.

For a moment, I wonder if the bright afternoon is making her fainter than usual.

“Here,” I say, clipping a deep red rose. I offer it to her. The stem rests against her palm, trembling—but it holds. I breathe out, quietly relieved. She’s still here, still with me.

I cut a few more, passing them one by one, and she arranges them with slow, delicate grace. It’s the only thing that still brings her joy, this small act of tending beauty in a place that’s forgotten colour.

“Lucien.” Her voice comes soft, turned away from me as she settles before her grave again. “Do you think Henri has forgotten me?”

The question lodges in my chest like a stone.

Sometimes I tell her the truth straightaway; sometimes I let her linger in the dream. And every time, she forgets by morning—memory slipping through her like sand through an hourglass. Lately, it happens more often as she withdraws deeper into grief. Perhaps she’s always been fading quietly while I went on pretending not to see. The light in her eyes dulls a little more with every sunset, like a lantern running low on oil. But I can’t bring myself to face it. Odette has been the one fixed thing in this place of passing; I wouldn’t know who I am without her watching over the roses.

I lower myself onto the gravel beside her. “Henri never forgot you,” I tell her. “He came every day. Ten o’clock, never later.”

A small, trembling smile tugs at her lips. “Ah, my Henri. Always punctual, bless him.”

“Every morning he brought a single red rose,” I go on. “And his violin. I’d never heard live music before him. Gideon used to stop work to listen.”

Odette’s eyes glisten. “His violin is a marvel. He plays for St Mary’s every Sunday.”

“Yes,” I whisper. “He did. For years.” I pause, the air thickening between us. “Then one morning, the music stopped. We waited together here, on this bench, remember?”

She shakes her head, slow and uncertain. But I see the flicker—the tiny recognition she tries to hide.

“He came back to us a few days later,” I say gently. “No violin this time—just silence, and the scent of roses. They brought him here in a wooden box, and with him, a note in his own hand. His last wish was that a hundred red roses should be placed around your grave. His final gift to you, Odette.”

She bows her head, shoulders trembling. The air shivers with her quiet grief. I put an arm around her, though I can barely feel the weight of her there.

At last, she lifts her gaze to the headstone. Her hand drifts over the carved letters, tracing them as though they might anchor her to what’s real.

Odette Rose Delacruz

and

Henri Thomas Delacruz

Forever entwined

Her voice breaks on a breath. “He’s gone… truly gone.”

I nod.

And even as I tell her the truth, a quiet doubt seeps through me—because I can’t help but wonder if mercy, sometimes, is just another kind of cruelty.

Odette stays where she is, her ghostly shape still and small against the headstone. The roses breathe around her, petals stirring in the wind. I watch as she stares at the names carved into stone, lips moving soundlessly, lost to her own grief.

The sun is sinking behind the cypress, and the shadows stretch long across the ground—striping the hill in bands of gold and blue. The air has cooled to that hour’s hush when the birds grow still, and only the grass whispers.

I trundle the barrow along the path, the wheel bumping over stones. Inside, the squares of turf lie stacked like green tiles—freshly cut from the verge by the fence where the ground grows thick and glossy. I’d sliced them clean with the edging spade earlier, lifted them whole and laid them here to rest on damp sacking. They’re good, even pieces—roots still moist, soil clinging beneath. Perfect for taking hold.

At the new grave, I stop. The earth has settled since the burial, the mound lowered by rain and time. I kneel beside it, the smell of loam rising rich and sweet. The soil is cool beneath my palm, sun-warmed only on the surface.

With the spade, I scrape the top flat, breaking the crust where it’s hardened, and dress it smooth. Then I take the first turf, press it down firm with my hands, and pat the edges into the soil. Piece by piece, I lay the green back where brown once showed—each patch overlapping the next, a quiet mending.

The barrow creaks softly behind me; the rowan stirs, its leaves chiming faintly in the breeze before falling still again.

“If only a slap of grass could make death beautiful,” says a voice—gentle, wistful, without a hint of mockery.

I glance over my shoulder. The lad is standing beneath the rowan, sunlight freckling through the branches onto his face. His satchel hangs across his chest, heavy with whatever things the dead still think they’ll need. He looks out over the valley, eyes soft with that faraway sadness—the kind that only wish to belong again, somewhere down there, where life still happens.

It’s hard, when people say things like that—statements. A question I can handle; yes or no has a shape to it, something to hold. But a statement asks you to understand it, to turn it over like soil until you find an opinion. And I try, I really do. I take their words as seeds, wonder what might grow if I tend them right. But by the time I find the meaning, it’s often too late to say it aloud.

So… can nature pacify death? Ah, that’s a difficult one. I’d say yes, but when does grief end and peace be—

“I suppose—” his voice cuts clean through my thoughts, “—if death’s part of the earth’s rhythm, then it’s only right she gathers us back into her keeping. A closing of the circle, neat and quiet. Nothing cruel in it at all.”

That’s… exactly what I’d meant to say. I find myself nodding before I realise it.

He glances over, sunlight shifting in his hair. “I’m Nat, by the way.”

He steps forward, easy, offering his hand.

I step back, automatic, hands half-raised in something like surrender. “Lu-Lucien. Er… sorry. I’m all muddy.”

His smile doesn’t falter. He just drops to the grass beneath the rowan, cross-legged, as though he’s always sat there. The branches sigh above him, and the air eases around us both.

I turn back to the barrow, lifting the next square of turf.

Calm down. Nothing to fret over. Ghosts are usually self-contained; they keep to their own sorrows, don’t ask anything of you. That’s what I like about them—they never expect me to be anything I’m not.

Still, I glance over. Nat has pulled a drawing pad from his satchel and is busy with a few sticks of charcoal, his movements quick, assured. Smudges of grey already bloom across the paper, his fingers stained dark. There’s something intentional about the way he works—conscious, like the world still speaks to him, even now.

I drop my gaze back to the turf in my hands, press it into the mound with careful fingers. One by one, the squares fit together, green over brown, until the earth looks mended again. When the last piece is laid, I tamp it down flat, the soil breathing steady beneath my palms.

The evening light runs across the blades of grass, catching the faint sheen of dew. For a moment, the grave looks peaceful.

So yes—if he’s still listening—perhaps a slap of grass can soften grief after all, if only for a little while.

The evening settles gentle and gold. I brush the soil from my spade, from the rake’s teeth, stacking them neat in the barrow. The earth clings to everything—under the nails, at the cuffs—but I don’t mind. It’s an honest weight of the job.

When I glance up, Nat’s watching me. He smiles, though there’s a thread of sadness running through it.

“The grass makes it real,” he says. “The earth’s finally closed over him.”

“The earth will close over all of us, sooner or later,” I answer, meaning it more kindly than it sounds.

The thought drifts in before I can stop it—why can I see them? And what am I supposed to do once I do? I line the tools in the barrow with pointless care, the kind of small order that keeps the world steady. Instead of leaving, I find myself sitting down opposite him.

“You can take your time,” I say. “Most folk who linger move on once they’ve made peace. Maybe when your headstone arrives.”

Nat glances up, tilts his head. “Yeah. I don’t know. It’s nice here. Quiet. Easy to think.”

“Right.” I look down at the grass between us, tracing the pattern of soil through the roots.

Truth is, I don’t know what happens when they go. I don’t understand what binds them here, or what could ever make them ready to leave. I only know that if they linger too long, they change. They forget who they were, what they loved—until they’re nothing but the echo of a single desire. Like Old Chap by the west gate, still waiting for the war to end.

“Hey, Lucy.”

The name makes me flinch. “Lucy?”

“Yeah,” he grins. “Lucy and Nat. Sweet, isn’t it?”

He laughs, light and sudden, like it’s a private joke meant only for him—something small and secret he finds funny about the world that no one else quite sees. “Can you move into the light a bit more?”

I shift, wary, the air between us oddly still. “What are you doing?”

He lifts the charcoal stick and air-measures the distance, eyes narrowing with focus. “I’m drawing you.”

I jolt, hand flying to tug my hood lower—only to realise I never put it on. A sharp pulse of panic flickers beneath my ribs, the old instinct to hide before the world can look too closely.

But he doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t even step back.

I force my breath steady and lift the hood over my head, slow, deliberate, as if it were nothing at all.

Maybe he doesn’t really see me. Odette never does—she only senses when I’m near, like a change in the weather.

Still, curiosity edges out the fear. I shift forward on my knees, creeping a little closer, as if the distance itself might explain him.

He tilts the pad towards me. “What do you think?”

I blink.

That confirms it—he doesn’t see me. The sketch shows a hand—mine, maybe—but the lines are taut, contorted.

I say, “Is it… angry?”

He huffs out a laugh. “How rude! But—yeah, I see it. Hands are tricky. I’ll get them right someday.” His voice falters, a shadow moving through it.

“Jonathan,” I murmur, wanting to comfort but finding no words that would fit.

“Nat,” he corrects. “Please. I insist. Jonathan’s in there.” He gestures with the charcoal towards the grave. “All forgotten about me.”

“But that’s—”

“My brother,” he says simply.

I stare at him, caught somewhere between disbelief and the sheer absurd weight of it all. The newly turfed grave lies quiet in front of us—green, neat, indisputable. And beside me, under the rowan’s sympathetic shade, sits a ghost who hasn’t yet realised he’s dead.

Gideon once said, a ghost that believes it’s alive is the loneliest kind. But what am I meant to do with that?

I let out a slow sigh, rubbing the back of my neck. Of course. My first disillusioned spirit needs a friend—and we’re already on nickname terms.

Something tells me this one’s going to be trouble.
