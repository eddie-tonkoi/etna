### `chapter_001.txt:15`

```text
I stop and glance behind the old rose bush, a vast, untamed thing whose branches arch like ribs over the gravel. Its blooms have come back with sudden abundance after the rain fortnight ago, crimson petals beaded with dew and the faint scent of rust. Beneath it stands Odette, her small shape half-lost in the green. She turns, eyes pale and clouded like morning mist. She’s been a quiet fixture in my days for as long as I can remember—a presence more than a person, a voice that returns no matter the season. I’ve often wondered if she truly sees me, or only feels the air shift where I stand. Best not to ask.
```

### `chapter_001.txt:29`

```text
The door creaks as I push it open. A man in a red cap steps out of the toilet, wiping his hands on his jeans. He gives me a nod—or maybe just a grunt—and mistakes me for another day-hand.
```

### `chapter_001.txt:39`

```text
“M-morning,” I mumble, hoping my voice stays small.
```

### `chapter_001.txt:43`

```text
She tears a sheet from the pad and scribbles notes with brisk, nervous movements. “Open plot DA73 for tomorrow’s service. Head-end to the west. And please remember the tarp under the spoil heap this time.”
```

### `chapter_001.txt:51`

```text
Still, I pull the leather-bound copy towards me and begin copying the details into my little book. I always write each name carefully, reverently—as if the act itself were prayer. For many of them, this will be the only trace of their lives I’ll ever hold.
```

### `chapter_001.txt:85`

```text
Plot DA73—the new zone, just beyond my cottage. I can see it in my mind already: the slope soft with grass, an old rowan keeping watch over the ground. Its branches are heavy with late-spring leaves—feathered green touched with copper, and clusters of white blossom that catch the light like scattered ash. The tree is older than anyone who’ll ever rest beneath it. From there, the view opens towards the valley below.
```

### `chapter_001.txt:137`

```text
If I’m being truthful, I don’t really mind these half-hearted jobs. They give me something to put right. My tribute to the dead, if you like.
```

### `chapter_002.txt:3`

```text
The morning lies still beneath a low sky. Cool air gathers in the hollows, damp with the scent of turned soil and morning dew. I pull on my coat and step out just after dawn, the world still half-asleep. The grass clings to my boots, whispering, and the stones wear their sheen like thin glass.
```

### `chapter_002.txt:109`

```text
The eyes drift towards me, the lids half-closed, a patient acknowledgement.
```

### `chapter_002.txt:121`

```text
I stop by the cottage to fetch the hand tamper. It’s purpose-made for the job, the handle worn smooth by years of use. The shepherd’s crook leans against the wall beside it. I take that too—might be out for a while.
```

### `chapter_003.txt:21`

```text
Obviously, he’s climbed back up again—bright-eyed, all energy and eagerness, as if death were nothing more than a brief nap.
```

### `chapter_003.txt:23`

```text
I turn the barrow away, the crunch of gravel loud in my ears. Friendliness has always unsettled me more than ghosts do; it asks for something I don’t have to give. Perhaps the lad will realise soon enough that he’s made the biggest mistake of his after-life, and take his leave in peace.
```

### `chapter_003.txt:97`

```text
At the new grave, I stop. The earth has settled since the burial, the mound lowered by rain and time. I kneel beside it, the smell of loam rising rich and sweet. The soil is cool beneath my palm, sun-warmed only on the surface.
```

### `chapter_003.txt:119`

```text
I step back, automatic, hands half-raised in something like surrender. “Lu-Lucien. Er… sorry. I’m all muddy.”
```

### `chapter_003.txt:121`

```text
His smile doesn’t falter. He just drops to the grass beneath the rowan, cross-legged, as though he’s always sat there. The branches sigh above him, and the air eases around us both.
```

### `chapter_003.txt:125`

```text
Calm down. Nothing to fret over. Ghosts are usually self-contained; they keep to their own sorrows, don’t ask anything of you. That’s what I like about them—they never expect me to be anything I’m not.
```

### `chapter_003.txt:163`

```text
He lifts the charcoal stick and air-measures the distance, eyes narrowing with focus. “I’m drawing you.”
