## Duplicate Phrase Check — what this script does

This tool hunts for **near-identical lines** across your chapter files — the
sort of repeated phrasing that often comes from copying a line, rewriting it in
another chapter, but not quite matching the original wording. It’s especially
useful for catching stock phrases that have drifted.

It works in several stages:

1. **Extracts meaningful lines from each chapter**
   - Loads each `.txt` file in `chapters/`.
   - Strips chapter headings.
   - Ignores very short lines and common structural headings such as
     *Tuesday afternoon*, *Sunday evening*, or all‑caps register labels.
   - Each remaining line (with its filename and line number) becomes a candidate
     phrase.

2. **Filters with a token-overlap test**
   - Before doing any fuzzy matching, the script checks whether two lines share
     enough meaningful words.
   - This removes most of the noise and keeps the comparisons fast.

3. **Uses a very high fuzzy threshold**
   - Only lines with a fuzz ratio ≥ `95` are kept — these are truly
     near-identical.
   - Whitelisted phrases are skipped entirely.

4. **Counts how often each phrase appears**
   - Builds a global frequency map so the report can highlight when one phrase
     is a “standard form” (used many times) and another is a one‑off variant.

5. **Sorts by significance**
   - Results are ordered by:
     - highest occurrence count,
     - then asymmetry between the two phrases,
     - then fuzzy score.
   - This floats genuine drifts to the top.

6. **Writes a clear markdown report**
   - For each match, shows:
     - the two locations,
     - the fuzzy score,
     - how often each phrase appears,
     - and the two phrase blocks.
   - If one phrase is widely used and the other appears only once, the report
     adds a warning line so you can spot a likely unintended change.

The goal is to be quiet but sharp — cutting out structural noise and surfacing
only the lines that are suspiciously similar, where a repeated phrase may not
have stayed consistent.
