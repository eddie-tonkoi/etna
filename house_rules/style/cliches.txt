a chill ran down
a cold sweat
a lump in
a glimmer of hope
a heavy heart
a hushed silence
a shiver ran down
a whirlwind of emotions
as if on cue
at the end of the day
back from the dead
beyond the grave
blood ran cold
breathe a sigh of relief
broke into a run
burning with rage
burst into tears
but at what cost
by the book
calm before the storm
come full circle
dead silence
deathly silence
easier said than done
every fiber of
fighting back tears
flashes of memory
free as a bird
frozen in place
full of life
ghost of a chance
give it my all
grit my teeth
haunted by the past
heart pounding
heart skipped a beat
held my breath
hit rock bottom
hot on his heels
in a flash
in the blink of an eye
in the heat of the moment
jumped out of my skin
last but not least
leave no stone unturned
like nothing happened
light as a feather
looked death in the face
lost in thought
mind raced
nerves of steel
next thing I knew
one step at a time
out of the blue
out of the corner of my eye
pain shot through
pinned to the spot
racing against the clock
ran for his life
reached a breaking point
reluctant hero
rushed to his side
safe and sound
screamed at the top of
shattered dreams
shoulders slumped
shot a glance
silent tears
slammed the door
slowly but surely
snap out of it
soul-crushing
stared into the abyss
stood like a statue
storm was brewing
struck dumb
swept off her feet
tears welled up
that’s all she wrote
the calm before the storm
the clock is ticking
the final nail
the rest is history
things went south
threw caution to the wind
took my breath away
touched a nerve
under the weather
voice trembled
waited with bated breath
wasn’t supposed to happen
watched helplessly
what are the odds
when the dust settled
without a second thought
woke with a start
you could hear a pin drop
